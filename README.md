# Flutter API App Assignment

## Overview: in this task, we are tasked to make a small application, using an API of our choosing.

### Amiibo Finder
This app is quite simple, it enables the user to search for any of the released amiibos and thier name and game.
The user can type and then search for any amiibo by clicking on search, if they send an empty search field they will get all the amiibos.

## P.S
Using the web browser is recommended since the API reacts wierdly when used on a simulator.

hope you like this project, and I hope you find your favourite amiibo.
